          <h3>Workshop on Advances in Image Processing</h3>
          <p>
            Biometric technology has been in use for several decades now and has proven to be
            a reliable and secure method of identity authentication. However, it is also a field that
            continues to advance and evolve, with new developments and innovations emerging
            regularly. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have enabled
            biometric systems to become more accurate and efficient, with the ability to learn and adapt
            to new patterns and data over time. This has resulted in improved performance, reduced
            error rates, and increased convenience for users. The development of new biometric
            modalities, such as vein recognition, gait analysis, and DNA biometrics, has expanded the
            range of options available for identity authentication, providing greater flexibility and
            adaptability to different security requirements. Another important area of advancement in
            biometrics is in the integration of multiple biometric modalities, known as multimodal
            biometrics. By combining two or more biometric factors, such as facial recognition and voice
            recognition, multimodal systems can offer even greater accuracy and security, with reduced
            vulnerability to fraud and hacking attempts. The increasing prevalence of biometric
            technology in everyday life, such as in smartphones and other consumer devices, has
            helped to drive further innovation and development in the field, as well as greater
            acceptance and adoption by the public. Biometrics has expanded its wings and a lot of
            research on Animal Biometrics in the recent past has given us motivating results. Overall,
            biometric technology is an established and reliable method of identity authentication, but it is
            also a field that continues to advance and evolve, with new developments and innovations
            emerging regularly. As the technology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even
            greater improvements in accuracy, security, and convenience for users. This talk is intended
            to highlight the milestones achieved in the domain so far and ignite the minds of young
            researchers with recent advances and newer challenges in the domain.

          <p>
            Text analysis and Information Extraction &amp; Retrieval (TIER 2024): The Eighth Edition of
            workshop (TIER-2024) seeks to foster growth and excellence in the emerging NLP
            community. This time. the theme of the workshop is “Explainable AI (XAI)” which involves
            making AI models transparent and interpretable so that humans can comprehend why a
            certain decision was made or a particular prediction was generated. This workshop focuses on
            applying XAI techniques specifically to text analytics opens numerous possibilities for
            improving the transparency and interpretability of natural language processing (NLP) models.
            Participants of this workshop can gain a comprehensive understanding of how XAI
            techniques can be applied to text analytics models, ultimately leading to more effective and
            responsible use of AI in natural language processing applications.
            The workshop features talks by experts in XAI and a hands-on session exploring tools that
            offer diverse options for implementing XAI techniques in text analytics.
